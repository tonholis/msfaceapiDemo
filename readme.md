### The Yale Face Database samples

The database contains 165 GIF images of 15 subjects (subject01, 
subject02, etc.).  There are 11 images per subject, one  for each 
of the following facial expressions or configurations: center-light, 
w/glasses, happy, left-light, w/no glasses, normal, right-light, 
sad, sleepy, surprised, and wink.  Note that the image "subject04.sad" 
has been corrupted and has been substituted by "subject04.normal".

You are free to use the Yale Face Database for research purposes. 
If experimental results are obtained that use images from within the
database, all publications of these results should acknowledge the use
of the "Yale Face Database" and cite 

P. Belhumeur, J. Hespanha, D. Kriegman, �Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces: Recognition Using Class Specific Linear Projection,� IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, July 1997, pp. 711-720.

Without permission from Yale, images
from within the database cannot be incorporated into a larger database
which is then publicly distributed.
